//! Define an interface Book with properties title, author, and publishedYear. Create a function toggleReadStatus that accepts a Book object and returns a new object with an added isRead property (boolean), defaulting to true.

interface Book {
  title: string;
  author: string;
  publishedYear: number;
}

const toggleReadStatus = (book: Book): Book & { isRead: boolean } => {
  return {
    ...book,
    isRead: true,
  };
};

const myBook = {
  title: "TypeScript Guide",
  author: "Jane Doe",
  publishedYear: 2024,
};

const result = toggleReadStatus(myBook);
console.log(result);
